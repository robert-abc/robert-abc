# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a summary of my repositories:

## Source code of research papers:
- **HDC-DIP**: "_Restoring severely out-of-focus blurred text images with Deep Image Prior_" (Doi: 10.3934/ipi.2022064)
- **HTC2022-Sparse-DIP**: "_Deep image prior with sparsity constraint for limited-angle computed tomography reconstruction_" (Doi: 10.3934/ammc.2023009)
- **KTC2023-ABC1**: "_Post-processing electrical impedance tomography reconstructions with incomplete data using convolutional neural networks_" (Doi: 10.3934/ammc.2024008)

## Codes: Preliminary versions
- **helsinki**: The first version of the **HDC-DIP** repository. This is the initial code we submitted to _Helsinki Deblurring Challenge 2021_.
- **KTC2023-ABC2**: Deep Image Prior code submitted to _Kuopio Tomography Challenge 2023_. We used this as a reference method to compare the results of **KTC2023-ABC1**
